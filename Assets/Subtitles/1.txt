This is a clip from one of my favourite films: 
Solar Breath (2002) by Michael Snow.

00:00:29,170 --> 00:00:35,200
Filming a window in his house from a fixed camera angle, 
Snow captures a beautiful everyday moment.

The wind lifts the curtain, ghostly, 
sometimes revealing glimpses outside.

Before pulling it back in splat and forming fluttering, 
transient images, pushed up against the glass.

00:00:57,22 --> 00:01:06,08
Itâ€™s a simple piece of work that, I think, successfully 
elevates a slice of life moment into an eerie and captivating moment of beauty.

My window behaves similarly, but it is not beautiful.
